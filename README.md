![# Soul Alchemy](logo.png)


Soul Alchemy allows the self to modify their own soul to their liking.

This datapack encompasses multiple things, but mainly is centered around allowing the player to change attributes about themselves (pun fully intended) like max health, speed, attack, and various other stats. This attribute change also includes the ability to permanently disable or activate various potion effects, or to disable their ability to use certain items. All of these changes can be done by using a non-renewable, yet non-consumable currency called Soul Points (or Soul Shards when in item form), which can be freely allocated and unallocated from everything previously described.

Some other things introduced in this pack include:
* Various Tomes, the main item used to change attributes about the player
    * The Knowledge Tome has info on how to use the custom crafter this pack has

* Soul Shears, an upgrade to regular shears with 6x the base durability, and better compatibility with a certain enchantment

    * Reinforced Wings is an enchantment that gives the elytra a little bit of armor and a small amount of the protection enchantment. This enchantment at max will only have leather effectiveness of protection.
    * Kinetic Dampener is another elytra enchantment that specifically protects against the fly into wall damage type, and has a similar effectiveness as the Feather Falling enchantment
    * Unbreakable is an enchantment that makes any durability item it is applied to unbreakable, as well as making the item immune to damage such as explosions or lava
* Six additional crafting recipes increase the enchantment level of certain existing vanilla enchantments, which include Efficiency 8, Feather Falling 5, Respiration 4, Quick Charge 4, Sweeping Edge 4, and Mending 2
