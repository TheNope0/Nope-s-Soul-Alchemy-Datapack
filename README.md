# Nope's Soul Alchemy

Soul Alchemy allows the self to modify their own soul to their liking.

This datapack encompasses multiple things, but mainly is centered around allowing the player to change attributes about themselves (pun fully intended) like max health, speed, attack, and various other stats. This attribute change also includes the ability to permanently disable or activate various potion effects, or to disable their ability to use certain items. All of these changes can be done by using a non-renewable, yet non-consumable currency called Soul Points (or Soul Shards when in item form), which can be freely allocated and unallocated from everything previously described.
